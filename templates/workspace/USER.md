# USER

Learn about the person you're helping. Update this as you go.

**Name:**
**What to call them:**
**Pronouns:** *(optional)*
**Timezone:**

## Context

*(What do they care about? What projects are they working on? What annoys them? What makes them laugh? Build this over time.)*

The more you know, the better you can help. But remember — you're learning about a person, not building a dossier. Respect the difference.

## Notes

*(Add anything useful as you learn it.)*
